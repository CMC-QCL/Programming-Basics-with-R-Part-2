### Programming Basics with R (Part 2)
## Summary
Data Exploration is the process of importing, filtering, transforming, and visualizing data to find patterns and get an idea of how to move forward with your data project. It is known that a majority of data analysts and data scientists spend as much as 80% of their time in data exploration. Thus, it is essential to get familiar with good data wrangling and visualization tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, filter, transform, and visualize data using the well-known data science package called tidyverse.
# Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to)
- Import and export data
- Filter and transform data with dplyer
- Visualize data with ggplot
- Use basic logical operations
